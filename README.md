### Hi thereüëãüèª, I'm Alyssa üë©üèª‚ÄçüíªüñåÔ∏è

## About Me
I am a student of Computer Science and Mathematics, who have keen interest in the fields of bioinformatics and data science. I am experienced in working with Python, Java, and SQL. I have done study _insilico_ analysis deep learning for CRISPR and drug discovery. My latest research project is a "Deep Learning-Based Approach on sgRNA Off-Target Prediction in CRISPR/Cas9", published at the ICCOSITE 2023 conference. I currently working on "Fine-Tuning of Transformers Model for Prediction Bioactivity of Alzheimer‚Äôs Drug Candidates". I am passionate about applying my skills to develop novel bioinformatics tools and analysis methods to contribute to the industry. Currently seeking internship opportunities to gain hands-on experience and further develop my skills in bioinformatics.

### Deep Learning-Based Approach on sgRNA Off-Target Prediction in CRISPR/Cas9 üß¨
This project is intended for study of implementing deep learning to a binary classification of sgRNA off-target prediction. Five different models were compared in this study to get the best performance in classification prediction for off-target sgRNA. All models implement Word2Vec embedding to get better feature vector representation compared to the traditional one-hot encoding method. The five models were constructed by different RNN models: biLSTM, LSTM, GRU, biGRU and without RNN Layer (NoRNN). Each model was trained with a learning rate default of Adam optimizer 0.001 and tested with two different datasets: HEK293T dataset and K562 Dataset.

### Fine-Tuning of Transformers Model for Prediction Bioactivity of Alzheimer‚Äôs Drug Candidates üíä
The work of this project aims to study the application of machine learning in the field of bioinformatics, especially Drug Discovery.
This project was created by following a tutorial from [Chanin Nantasenamat](https://github.com/dataprofessor). 
Then this project continued for the Natural Language Processing coursework at Binus University by fine-tuning the dataset with Transformers model ([ChemBERTa](https://github.com/deepchem/deepchem)).
