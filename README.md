### Hi thereüëãüèª, I'm Alyssa üë©üèª‚Äçüíª

## About Me
I am a student of Computer Science and Mathematics, who have keen interest in the fields of bioinformatics and data science. I am experienced working with Python, Java, and SQL. I have done study _insilico_ analysis for CRISPR, drug discovery and genome mutation detection. My latest research project is a "Deep Learning-Based Approach on sgRNA Off-Target Prediction in CRISPR/Cas9", published at the ICCOSITE 2023 conference. I currently working on "Fine-Tuning of Transformers Model for Prediction Bioactivity of Alzheimer‚Äôs Drug Candidates". I am passionate about applying my skills to develop novel bioinformatics tools and analysis methods to contribute to the industry. Currently seeking internship opportunities to gain hands-on experience and further develop my skills in bioinformatics.

## My Projects
### Deep Learning-Based Approach on sgRNA Off-Target Prediction in CRISPR/Cas9
This project is intended for study of implementing deep learning to a binary classification of sgRNA off-target prediction. Five different models were compared in this study to get the best performance in classification prediction for off-target sgRNA. All models implement Word2Vec embedding to get better feature vector representation compared to the traditional one-hot encoding method. The five models were constructed by different RNN models: biLSTM, LSTM, GRU, biGRU and without RNN Layer (NoRNN). Each model was trained with a learning rate default of Adam optimizer 0.001 and tested with two different datasets: HEK293T dataset and K562 Dataset.
